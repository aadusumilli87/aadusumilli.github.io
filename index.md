## Amar Adusumilli's Portfolio Webiste

This website is intended to serve as a portfolio of projects I have completed, for academic purposes or otherwise. My hope is that it provides a useful means to share my work, in addition to documenting my skillset as it (hopefully) increases.

## Academic Projects

#### Testing the Poverty-Inequality-Growth Triangle in the United States
In this paper, I test whether former World Bank Chief Economist Fran√ßois Bourguignon's Poverty-Inequality-Growth hypothesis holds in the United States using a vector autoregressive approach, with macroeconomic data sourced from the FRED database. The paper was created with an R markdown document and the analysis was conducted in R. The repo, containing the final paper, constituent Rmd file, and source code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/aadusumilli87/Time-Series-Paper).

#### Copula Simulation
In this project, I conduct 256 simulations of ten-day changes in 4 financial assets using a Vine Copula to model the joint behavior of the 4 assets. From the simulations, Value at Risk metrics corresponding to desired percentiles can be obtained. The code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/aadusumilli87/Copula-Simulation).

#### Predicting Property Values in Philadelphia
Using regression techniques to predict home prices in Philadelphia from property assessment data. This was my first grad school project and is admittedly rather rough around the edges, however I decided to upload it for a few reasons. The foremost reason is that it contains some of my best visualizations - heatmaps of Philadelphia made using the sf GIS package. Additionally, the extraordinarily messy nature of the municipal property assessments data hopefully illustrates my ability to clean and wrangle data, as well employ some creativity with feature engineering. Code and paper are accessible [here](https://github.com/aadusumilli87/Philadelphia-Properties).
